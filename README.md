# Sharecuts
allows importing/exporting .shortcut files directly within the app rather than uploading to iCloud. It's an internal feature built into iOS presumably meant for employees eyes only. No options to configure, just look out for the "share as file" extension in the share sheet within the app, see the example video located in the repo for clarification
